# Fluid Templates
The Extension ships with some preconfigured Templates. 

> Important Note: The Extension ships with an extended Version of news link viewhelper. When you link to Detail Pages of events, you will ned this. Because the original can not link to action eventDetail, and so the Uris always wrong. Also the extended VH can create absolute urls, whats needed in E-Mails. 
    

## Views:
__Calendar__
...the famous Calendar

__CreateApplication__
What you see when you send the booking

__ConfirmApplication__
What you see when you confirmed the booking

__EventDetail__
The Event Detailview. Like the News Detail, but with more Details. 

__Qtip__ This you will find in Partials/Calendar. Its the little pop opens by hovering a event in calendar. You can put any information their you want from the event.
