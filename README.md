# dated_news
Extends the TYPO3 versatile news system extension tx_news with a calendar view... so it began in 2015....

## What it does
__Calendar View__ The extension extends tx_news by a calendar view. For the calendar a fully configurable Frontend Calendar is used. Your'e able to switch between different views f.e. monthly view or an agenda week view. 

__Event Registration__ It implements a recurring service so you can add recurring events in any imaginable configuration. 
For any event users can registrate for. Their are prices, early bird prices and of course earlybird dates. Any registration / booking needs a confirmation y clicking a link in E-Mail. If wished, the extension sends out an ICS Calendar Invitation after coonfirmation and also sends out additional files, f.e. your terms and conditions.
